# Triathlon Race Tracking: sample application from Frontend development with ASP.NET Core MVC, Angular and Bootstrap

In the last chapter of my [Frontend development with ASP.NET Core MVC, Angular and Bootstrap](http://amzn.to/2Fgxqaq) I refer to this repository for a more complete example of application using ASP.NET Core MVC, Angular and Bootstrap.

I'm still putting some final touches and I'll publish the code soon.

The code for all the samples in the book are available on the [Wrox website](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Front-end-Development-with-ASP-NET-Core-Angular-and-Bootstrap.productCd-1119181313,descCd-DOWNLOAD.html).
